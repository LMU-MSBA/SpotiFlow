## Metrics

### Key Performance Metric
- **User Interface Engagement Time**: This metric measures the amount of time the user spends on our recommendations page. The higher the number means the user is engaging 
with the content more either by searching the recommending songs or listening to them on the spot. 

## Hypotheses

- **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: Providing 3 recommendations instead of 5 does not significantly affect user engagement time.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: Providing 3 recommendations instead of 5 decreases user engagement time.

## Experimental Design

### Control and Experimental Groups
- **Control Group**: Users in this group will receive 5 recommendations as usual.
- **Experimental Group**: Users in this group will receive 3 recommendations instead.

### Randomization Process
- Users will be randomly assigned to either the control or experimental group upon logging into the platform to ensure unbiased distribution and valid test results.

### Duration of the Experiment
- The experiment will last for 30 days to collect enough data and observe any significant changes in user behavior.

### Sample Size Calculation
- Sample size will be calculated based on the expected effect size, power (typically 0.80), and significance level (typically 0.05).

## Implementation Plan

### Technical Requirements
- **Tools/Platforms**: The test will be implemented using the existing backend infrastructure with additional logging for group assignment and listening time.
- **Timeline**: Deployment planning for 1 week, running the test for 30 days, and data analysis for 1 week.
- **Ethical Considerations**: Ensure that all user data is handled confidentially and that users are not adversely affected by the test.

## Data Collection and Analysis

### Data Collection
- Data on user listening time will be collected through the platform's analytics tools, with group assignment tagged.

### Data Analysis
- Statistical analysis will be conducted using a t-test to compare the means between the two groups. This method will help determine if the observed differences in listening time are statistically significant.
